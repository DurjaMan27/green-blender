Experimenting with open source projects

GOAL OF OPEN SOURCE PROJECT:
The open source project will center around environmental sustainability, focusing on renewable energy and responsible investing. The project will be catered towards high school and college students interested in making a positive impact on the environment, whether it be in their community or in the world.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT/REASON FOR CREATION:
The purpose of this repository is for students to experiment with open source coding and collaboration through GitHub. The goal is to create an extensive and advanced open source project with a clear topic.

CONTENTS OF SITE:
1. CLEAN-UP PROJECT SIGNUPS - the site will feature local clean-up projects that will allow anyone to get out and contribute. Environmental groups will be able to post potential projects and the site will communicate their goals with students interested in making an impact.
2. IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS - the most important thing to get people's attention are statistics. Sadly, many of the statistics making headlines today are deeply concerning, yet many people are taking them for granted. Widely displaying these statistics will communicate the message further.
3. ENVIRONMENT-RELATED NEWS - this section goes hand-in-hand with the environmental statistics section. If students are not aware of what is going on around them, how can they be expected to make an impact?
4. FINANCE/ESG SCORES - In a world of open finance and smart investing, setting students on the right path to investing is crucial to encouraging large corporations to do their due diligence. Encouraging young students to look at values such as ESG scores, management, and carbon footprint will ensure that these students are making educated investments while also pushing companies to make a positive impact on the environment.
5. ACCOUNT - allows an user to create an account, sign in with an username and password, and connect with other users.
