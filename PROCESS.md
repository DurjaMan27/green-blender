# Process of creating open source project

GOAL #1: CLEAN-UP PROJECT SIGNUPS
Currently TBD.

GOAL #2: ARTICLES AND STATISTICS
Using a python package similar to Twython, we will scour the internet on a set schedule to find articles related to the environment and cycle these articles through the site. By using this package, the articles will be auto-updated and kept up-to-date. In addition to this package, we will use a Natural Language Processor to find important and relevant statistics that can be highlighted outside the article.

GOAL #3: ESG AND FINANCE
Using Yahoo Finance for stock market data, we will cycle through major companies and provide stock market data. We will also use packages such as DiscreteAllocation and PyPortfolioOpt to provide students with information on how to invest responsibly. Additionally, we will use the yesg package to download historical ESG score data from Yahoo Finance; hopefully, we want to display the companies with the highest stock risers and sustainability scores.

GOAL #4: CREATING A WEBSITE TO HOUSE ALL GOALS
Currently TBD.
