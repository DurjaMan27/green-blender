# How can you contribute?

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! There are numerous ways to contribute to this project, especially considering how it is in its early stages.

My goal is to inspire students to make positive impacts on the environment and spread their knowledge to others. The goal of this open source project is to do just that. By contributing to this project, I can see that you also understand the urgency of spreading this knowledge to the youth.

Currently, I am looking for ways to merge all goals into one website; whether that be through HTML, JavaScript, or any other language is up to you. In addition, I want to add more sources of information and activities to get more people involved. I have targeted finance (ESG investing) and current events (news and statistics), but there are many other ways to spread the message; please contribute what you can to help me build this project out. 

Thank you so much!
